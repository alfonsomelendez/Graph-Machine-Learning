# Explanation 1


we show an example using a particular embedding algorithm known as Node to Vector (Node2Vec).

In the preceding code, we have done the following:
1. We generated a barbell graph (described in the previous chapter).
2. The Node2Vec embedding algorithm is then used in order to map each node of the
graph in a vector of two dimensions.
3. Finally, the two-dimensional vectors generated by the embedding algorithm,
representing the nodes of the original graph, are plotted.
