# Explanation 1


we show an example using a particular embedding algorithm known as Node to Vector (Node2Vec).

In the preceding code, we have done the following:
1. We generated a barbell graph (described in the previous chapter).
2. The Node2Vec embedding algorithm is then used in order to map each node of the
graph in a vector of two dimensions.
3. Finally, the two-dimensional vectors generated by the embedding algorithm,
representing the nodes of the original graph, are plotted.

The result is shown in the following figure:

it is easy to see that nodes that have a similar structure are close to each
other and are distant from nodes that have dissimilar structures. It is also interesting
to observe how good Node2Vec is at discriminating group 1 from group 3. Since the
algorithm uses neighboring information of each node to generate the representation, the
clear discrimination of those two groups is possible.

Another example on the same graph can be performed using the Edge to Vector
(Edge2Vec) algorithm in order to generate a mapping for the edges for the same graph, G:





In the preceding code, we have done the following:
1. We generated a barbell graph (described in the previous chapter).
2. The HadamardEmbedder embedding algorithm is applied to the result of the
Node2Vec algorithm (keyed_vectors=model.wv) used in order to map each
edge of the graph in a vector of two dimensions.
3. Finally, the two-dimensional vectors generated by the embedding algorithm,
representing the nodes of the original graph, are plotted.
The results are shown in the following figure
