# Graph Machine learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that aims to provide systems with the
ability to learn and improve from data. It has achieved impressive results in many different
applications, especially where it is difficult or unfeasible to explicitly define rules to solve
a specific task. For instance, we can train algorithms to recognize spam emails, translate
sentences into other languages, recognize objects in an image, and so on.
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in applying machine learning to
graph-structured data. Here, the primary objective is to automatically learn suitable
representations to make predictions, discover new patterns, and understand complex
dynamics in a better manner with respect to "traditional" machine learning approaches.
